#CSCI Final Project by Rohit Goyal
Objective: Use GoogleMaps API and allow users to PinInterest any place in the world. I intend to build an application and understanding APIs
is critical. Therefore, wanted to explore it with using the following techniques: 
   (i) DOM element creation, deletion or modification
   (ii)Capturing and handling events
   (iii)Form Validation
   (iv) Closures
   (v) jquery
There are number of extensions that I have planned for this work like calculating distance between two points, integrate additional APIs to
provide more information about the geolocation etc. However, due to shortage of time (given that I am already on extension), I will plan on
finishing the code by early next year. The code is inspired from the help available at Google's developer's platform.
